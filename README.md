## ðŸ”¥ Tech Stack

`Astro` + `Tailwind CSS` + `TypeScript` + `ESLint` + `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any blog posts' images will be placed in the `public/images/` directory for using Image components to optimize and bundle them, and the website images will be stored in `src/images/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
