  summary: `
    Front-end engineer with four years of front-end development experience. During this period, I participated in the front-end development of reading community websites, real estate agency management platforms, travel planning community platforms, factory data analysis systems, and overseas marketing websites, and accumulated rich practical experience.
  
    I mainly use React and like its development freedom. I also like Vue's elegance and progressive development experience of Vue. I have an in-depth understanding and practical knowledge in front-end application scenarios.
    
    Technically, I am not only proficient in front-end development but also willing to dabble in knowledge in other fields including SEO, SSG, SDGs, Open Data, Data Visualization and other related issues. In addition, I also write technology blogs to share my experiences.
